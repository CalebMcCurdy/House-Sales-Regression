## Installation
To use this project, first clone the repository onto your local machine using the following commands:

git init

git clone https://github.com/CalebMcCurdy/House-Sales.git

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to develop a regression model that is able to predict house sales price dependent on an array of characteristics. After performing exploratory and correlation analysis, we use dimensional analysis to reduce the computational time while maintaining the accuracy. These results can be used to evaluate whether a house on the market is being undervalued, overvalued, or listed at a fair price.

## Project Description
Our dataset for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction. The data is in a .csv format with a size of 2.5 MB. There are 21,613 entries with 21 total columns for each: 20 predictors and 1 target variable. There are 4 columns with missing data so we will need to perform imputation on these records before continuing.

There are many factors that help determine the price of a house on the market. Among them are location, number of bedrooms, and size in square feet. With a predictive regression model that utilizes only the most important factors, we are able to give an estimate for the price a home with certain characteristics should expect to sell for. While there are other factors that cannot be added into the model, it can be used as a baseline for appraisals. While a similar strategy can be implemented in the future, more recent data is recommended to accurately depict the changes in the housing market.
